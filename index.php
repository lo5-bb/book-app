		<h1>Am I right?</h1>

		<p>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general
			direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to
			taunt you a second time! Well, she turned me into a newt. Shut up! Well, how'd you become king, then? But
			you are dressed as one&hellip; Did you dress her up like this?</p>

		<h2>Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic!</h2>

		<p>Now, look here, my good man. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I dunno. Must be a king. And the
			hat. She's a witch!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</li>
			<li>Well, we did do the nose.</li>
			<li>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Blue. No, yel&hellip;</h3>

		<p>Well, I got better. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! But you are
			dressed as one&hellip; You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly
			person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English
			K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, how'd you become king, then?</p>
		<h4>We want a shrubbery!!</h4>

		<p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Now, look here, my good man. Did
			you dress her up like this? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! No,
			no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. What do you mean?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Well, she turned me into a newt.</li>
			<li>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</li>
			<li>We found them.</li>
			<li>Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>Sir Lancelot</h5>

		<p>Bloody Peasant! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! We
			found them. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>

		<h6>What a strange person</h6>

		<p>I am your king. Look, my liege! Shut up! Will you shut up?! He hasn't got shit all over him. I don't want to
			talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your
			mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a
			second time!</p>

		<hr>

		<p>Burn her! How do you know she is a witch? I'm not a witch.</p>

		<p>Well, we did do the nose. We found them. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Well, we did do the
			nose.</p>

		<p>I have to push the pram a lot. And the hat. She's a witch! Bring her forward! Oh! Come and see the violence
			inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>

		<p>Burn her! Bloody Peasant! Oh, ow! Burn her anyway! Where'd you get the coconuts?</p>

		<p>Well, I didn't vote for you. He hasn't got shit all over him. Well, she turned me into a newt. Why? The
			Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! We want a shrubbery!!</p>

		<p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, I didn't vote for you. The swallow may fly south with the
			sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our
			land. I have to push the pram a lot. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>

		<p>And the hat. She's a witch! Why? Burn her! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no
			basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from
			some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

		<p>Shut up! Will you shut up?! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system
			of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical
			aquatic ceremony. Why? Now, look here, my good man. Well, how'd you become king, then?</p>

		<p>The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter,
			yet these are not strangers to our land. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to
			Camelot! Why? Shut up! Will you shut up?! I'm not a witch. But you are dressed as one&hellip;</p>

		<p>Where'd you get the coconuts? Did you dress her up like this? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! We shall say
			'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Look, my liege! Shut up! Will you shut up?!</p>

		<p>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! &hellip;Are you
			suggesting that coconuts migrate? I dunno. Must be a king. Well, she turned me into a newt.</p>

		<p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! I dunno. Must be a king. Well, what
			do you want? I am your king. How do you know she is a witch?</p>

		<p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Look, my liege! Be quiet! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your
			new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Now, look here, my good man. Look, my liege!</p>

		<p>Be quiet! Look, my liege! Burn her anyway! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms,
			sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English
